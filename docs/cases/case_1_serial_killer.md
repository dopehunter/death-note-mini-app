# Case #1: The Serial Killer

## Case Overview

A series of mysterious deaths has occurred in Tokyo over the past month. All victims died of heart attacks, but they share a common trait - all were criminals who had escaped justice through legal loopholes or insufficient evidence. The police are baffled by these deaths, as there are no signs of traditional murder methods. Someone appears to be targeting criminals who evaded the legal system, leading to speculation about a vigilante killer.

## Background Story

For the past several weeks, Tokyo has been experiencing an unusual pattern of deaths. News outlets have begun connecting the dots - criminals who escaped conviction are suddenly dying of heart attacks. The timing and pattern of deaths cannot be coincidental. The police have formed a special task force, but they have no leads. As Light Yagami (played by the user), you've been following these cases closely, and with the power of the Death Note now in your hands, you must identify the real culprit who is using a similar power.

## Evidence Details

### Evidence 1: Crime Scene Photos
**Title:** Crime Scene Photos
**Description:** Photos showing victims died clutching their chests. No signs of struggle or forced entry.
**Analysis:** The victims all appear to have died suddenly and in visible pain, clutching at their chests - classic signs of heart attacks. There are no indications of poison, weapons, or physical violence. Most notably, all scenes show the victims alone at the time of death, with no forced entry or signs of struggle, suggesting either a natural death or a method that doesn't require physical presence.
**Relevance:** The method of killing aligns with Death Note usage - heart attacks that leave no traditional evidence.

### Evidence 2: Victim List
**Title:** Victim List
**Description:** All victims were criminals who had escaped prosecution or received light sentences.
**Analysis:** The comprehensive list reveals a pattern - all 8 victims had criminal records and either:
1. Escaped conviction on technicalities
2. Received sentences considered too lenient for their crimes
3. Were awaiting trial but were released on bail
The crimes range from fraud and embezzlement to more serious offenses like assault and suspected homicide.
**Relevance:** The clear pattern suggests someone with access to criminal records and a strong sense of justice, targeting those who "got away with it."

### Evidence 3: Surveillance Footage
**Title:** Surveillance Footage
**Description:** One victim was caught on camera dying suddenly at a cafe. A businessman in a suit was watching from across the street.
**Analysis:** Footage from a security camera shows the third victim, a suspected embezzler, sitting at a cafe when he suddenly clutches his chest and collapses. Of particular interest is a businessman in a dark suit observed watching the victim from across the street. The businessman makes a note in what appears to be a small black notebook, then walks away moments after the victim collapses.
**Relevance:** This is the only evidence showing a potential suspect present near a death scene, suggesting direct observation of the killing.

## Suspect Profiles

### Suspect 1: Higuchi Kyosuke
**Name:** Higuchi Kyosuke
**Description:** A businessman who works at Yotsuba Group. Has expressed extreme views about justice on social media.
**Background:** Higuchi is a mid-level executive at the Yotsuba Group, with access to company resources and databases. His social media profiles show increasingly radical views about justice and punishment, arguing that "criminals who escape the system deserve death." His position gives him financial stability and the freedom to move throughout Tokyo without raising suspicion.
**Clues:**
1. Was seen near the location of the third murder.
2. Has access to criminal records through company database.
3. Recent promotion coincided with start of killings.
**Guilt Status:** Guilty (True culprit)
**Motive:** Believes himself to be executing justice and clearing society of those who abuse the legal system. His recent promotion has given him both the confidence and resources to act on his extreme beliefs.

### Suspect 2: Misa Amane
**Name:** Misa Amane
**Description:** A popular model whose parents were murdered. The killer was never brought to justice.
**Background:** Misa is a rising star in the modeling world, with a tragic past. Her parents were murdered during a home invasion, and though a suspect was arrested, he was released due to mishandled evidence. This traumatic experience left her with a deep distrust of the justice system and a potential motive for vigilante justice.
**Clues:**
1. Publicly supports the mysterious killings.
2. Has an alibi for two of the murder times.
3. Shows no signs of the calculated planning evident in the crimes.
**Guilt Status:** Innocent
**Motive:** While she has expressed support for the mysterious deaths, claiming "someone is finally doing what the courts won't," her schedule as a model provides alibis for at least two of the killings. Her public statements seem more like reaction than guilty knowledge.

### Suspect 3: Teru Mikami
**Name:** Teru Mikami
**Description:** A prosecutor who has lost several high-profile cases against obvious criminals.
**Background:** Mikami is a dedicated prosecutor who has become increasingly frustrated with the justice system. He has lost several cases against defendants he strongly believed were guilty, due to technicalities or defense attorney tactics. His colleagues have noticed his growing bitterness about these outcomes.
**Clues:**
1. Was out of the country during two of the killings.
2. Has expressed frustration with the justice system.
3. Works within legal channels despite his frustration.
**Guilt Status:** Innocent
**Motive:** While his frustration with criminals escaping justice gives him a clear motive, passport records confirm he was abroad during two of the killings, making it impossible for him to be the culprit. Additionally, he continues to work within the system despite setbacks, showing a commitment to legal justice.

## Investigation Path and Logic

### Ideal Investigation Sequence
1. **Review Victim List** - Establish pattern of targeting escaped criminals
2. **Examine Crime Scene Photos** - Confirm heart attack deaths with no physical evidence
3. **Review Surveillance Footage** - Identify businessman with notebook (Higuchi)
4. **Analyze Suspect Profiles** - Compare alibis, means, and motives
5. **Consider the Death Note Mechanism** - Realize the killer needs a face and name, but not physical presence

### Logical Deduction
The key to solving this case lies in recognizing several critical factors:

1. **Method**: The Death Note causes heart attacks, matching all victims' cause of death
2. **Selection**: Only criminals who escaped justice were targeted, suggesting access to records
3. **Evidence**: The surveillance footage shows a businessman matching Higuchi's description
4. **Opportunity**: Both Mikami and Misa have clear alibis for some killings, eliminating them
5. **Motive and Means**: Higuchi has both the strongest motive (expressed online) and the means (company access and freedom of movement)

## Solution

Higuchi Kyosuke is the culprit. The player should:
1. Use the Death Note to eliminate Higuchi
2. Submit Higuchi as their solution

### Solution Logic
- Higuchi matches the physical description from the surveillance footage
- He has no alibis for any of the killings
- His promotion timeline aligns with the beginning of the deaths
- He has expressed views that exactly match the killer's selection criteria
- He has access to criminal records through his company position
- Neither Misa nor Mikami could have committed all the killings due to alibis

## Teaching Elements

This case introduces players to core game mechanics:
1. **Evidence Analysis**: Learning to connect disparate clues
2. **Suspect Evaluation**: Weighing motives, means, and opportunity
3. **Death Note Usage**: Understanding the implications of using the notebook
4. **Case Resolution**: Experiencing the decision-making process and consequences

The case is deliberately straightforward, with clear evidence pointing to one suspect, to help players learn the game mechanics before facing more complex scenarios.
