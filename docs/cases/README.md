# Death Note Mini-App Cases

This directory contains detailed documentation for each case in the Death Note Mini-App game. These files serve as comprehensive design documents that explain the narrative, evidence, suspects, and solution logic for each case.

## Purpose

These case files serve several purposes:

1. **Game Design Reference** - Detailed documentation of the game's narrative and puzzle elements
2. **Onboarding Resource** - Help new developers understand the game structure and logic
3. **Content Expansion** - Provide templates for creating additional cases in the future
4. **Translation Reference** - Single source of truth when translating case content to other languages

## Case Structure

Each case file follows a consistent structure:

- **Case Overview** - Brief summary of the case scenario
- **Background Story** - Detailed narrative context for the case
- **Evidence Details** - Description, analysis, and relevance of each piece of evidence
- **Suspect Profiles** - Detailed information about each suspect including guilt status
- **Investigation Path and Logic** - The intended progression and reasoning process
- **Solution** - The correct solution and its logic
- **Teaching/Challenge Elements** - Educational or difficulty aspects of the case

## Current Cases

1. [Case #1: The Serial Killer](case_1_serial_killer.md) - An introductory case focused on a vigilante targeting criminals
2. [Case #2: The Corporate Conspiracy](case_2_corporate_conspiracy.md) - A more complex case involving corporate espionage and financial motives

## Creating New Cases

When creating new cases, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Difficulty Progression** - Each new case should introduce new mechanics or challenge levels
2. **Narrative Continuity** - Consider connections to previous cases where appropriate
3. **Balanced Evidence** - Provide a mix of obvious and subtle clues
4. **Clear Solution Logic** - Ensure there is a definitive logical path to the correct solution
5. **Educational Value** - Each case should teach players something new about deduction or the game world

## Implementation Notes

The implemented cases in the game simplify these detailed designs to fit the game's interface and mechanics. The actual in-game text is shorter and more focused, while these documents provide the complete design vision and logical framework.
