# Death Note Mini-App: Game Rules and Mechanics

## Overview

The Death Note Mini-App is a Telegram-based game where players assume the role of Light Yagami (Kira) from the Death Note anime/manga. Players must solve criminal cases by analyzing evidence, identifying suspects, and using the Death Note to eliminate those responsible.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Game Flow

1. **Case Introduction**: Each case presents a scenario involving criminals who have escaped justice
2. **Investigation**: Players must review evidence and suspect profiles to deduce who is guilty
3. **Decision Making**: Players decide which suspects to eliminate using the Death Note
4. **Case Resolution**: Players submit their solution to determine if they've caught the true culprit

### Resources Management

- **Death Note Uses**: Each case provides a limited number of Death Note uses (typically 2-3)
- **Days Remaining**: Actions like reviewing evidence or suspects consume in-game days
- **Time Management**: Players must solve the case before running out of days

### Winning Conditions

To successfully solve a case, players must:
1. Correctly identify the true culprit among the suspects
2. Eliminate the culprit using the Death Note (write their name)
3. Submit the correct solution before running out of days

## Game Elements

### Cases

Each case includes:
- A case title and description
- Multiple pieces of evidence
- A set of suspects (typically 3-4)
- A time limit (days)
- A limited number of Death Note uses

### Evidence

Evidence provides clues about:
- The nature of the crimes
- Connections to suspects
- Timeline of events
- Potential motives

### Suspects

Each suspect has:
- A name and description
- A set of clues/facts about them
- Potential motives or connections to the crime
- A guilt status (known only to the game)

### The Death Note

The Death Note mechanics are simplified for the game:
- Players can write a suspect's name to eliminate them
- The Death Note has limited uses per case
- Using the Death Note on innocent people has negative consequences
- Eliminating the true culprit is necessary to solve the case

## Gameplay Actions

### Reviewing Evidence

- Players can examine evidence collected for the case
- Each piece of evidence provides critical information
- This action consumes one in-game day

### Examining Suspects

- Players can review profiles of all suspects
- Each suspect profile includes background information and clues
- This action consumes one in-game day

### Using the Death Note

- Players can open the Death Note interface
- They can write a suspect's name to eliminate them
- The Death Note has limited uses per case
- This action does not consume an in-game day

### Solving the Case

- Players can submit their solution when ready
- They must identify who they believe is the culprit
- The culprit must be eliminated using the Death Note first
- This action concludes the current case

## Multilingual Support

The game supports multiple languages:
- English (default)
- Russian
- German

Players can switch languages at any time during gameplay without losing progress.

## Game Progression

The mini-app currently includes two cases with increasing difficulty:
1. **Case #1: The Serial Killer** - An introduction to the game mechanics
2. **Case #2: The Corporate Conspiracy** - A more complex case with additional challenges

Future updates may include additional cases and features.

## Integration with Ryuk Bot

- The mini-app is launched through the Telegram bot (Ryuk)

- Game results can be shared back to the Telegram chat
- Ryuk may comment on the player's choices and progress

## Game Strategy Tips

1. **Carefully read all evidence** before drawing conclusions
2. **Compare suspect alibis and clues** to identify inconsistencies
3. **Use the Death Note sparingly** - writing innocent names has consequences
4. **Manage your days efficiently** to avoid running out of time
5. **Consider all possibilities** before making your final decision

Remember, with the power of the Death Note comes great responsibility. Choose wisely who deserves judgment!
